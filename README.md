EMBEDDING ASSIGNMENT
Problem Statement:
This assignment aims to explore various text embedding techniques using a chosen dataset. By
implementing different embedding methods such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe,
and FastText, students will gain a deeper understanding of how to convert text into numerical
representations. These embeddings will be used to analyze and extract meaningful insights
from the dataset.
Guidelines:
1. Foundational Knowledge:
- Understand the principles of different embedding techniques and their applications.
- Familiarize yourself with the concepts of vector space models, word embeddings, and the
significance of context in text representation.
- Recognize the strengths and limitations of each embedding technique.
2. Embedding Techniques Implementation:
- Bag of Words (BoW): Implement the BoW model to represent text as a sparse matrix of word
counts.
- TF-IDF: Apply the TF-IDF model to weigh the importance of words in the text based on their
frequency and inverse document frequency.
- Word2Vec: Train a Word2Vec model to capture the semantic relationships between words
using the skip-gram or continuous bag of words (CBOW) approach.
- GloVe: Use pre-trained GloVe embeddings or train a GloVe model on the dataset to capture
global word-word co-occurrence statistics.
- FastText: Implement FastText embeddings to consider subword information and improve the
representation of rare words.
Step-by-Step Approach to Embedding Techniques:
1. Setup and Data Preparation:
- Import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, sklearn, gensim, matplotlib, seaborn.
- Load the dataset: Choose a dataset for embedding generation.
- Preprocess the text data: Perform cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and other
preprocessing steps.
2. Bag of Words (BoW):
- Create a BoW representation: Use `CountVectorizer` from sklearn to convert text into a
matrix of word counts.
- Analyze the BoW matrix: Examine the sparsity and interpret the word frequencies.
3. TF-IDF:
- Apply TF-IDF transformation: Use `TfidfVectorizer` to generate TF-IDF features from the text
data.
- Interpret TF-IDF scores: Analyze how TF-IDF weighs different words in the dataset.
4. Word2Vec:
- Train a Word2Vec model: Use Gensim's `Word2Vec` to train a model on the dataset.
- Extract word vectors: Obtain vector representations for words and visualize them.
5. GloVe:
- Use pre-trained GloVe embeddings: Load GloVe vectors and map words in the dataset to
their corresponding embeddings.
- Train a GloVe model (optional): Use the GloVe package to train embeddings if desired.
6. FastText:
- Train a FastText model: Use Gensimâ€™s `FastText` to train embeddings that consider subword
information.
- Analyze FastText embeddings: Compare them with Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings.
Dataset for the Assignment:
- Use any Dataset and Create Embeddings
Submission:
- Detailed Documents: A report detailing each embedding technique, the process followed, and
the results obtained.
- Jupyter Notebook: A notebook containing all code, explanations, and visualizations for the
assignment.
